What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
1. .git directory is created 
2. so we can do version control by git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans: Staging area 不是一個實體的存在 是一個觀念上存在，用來讓每次的
     commit 符合"每次只進行一種邏輯的修改"

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical chang?
Ans: once I make a logical change, "git add" it to a statge, then commit it with clear message, 
then I can move on to next logical I want to do.
